# Obsidian Markdown Commands

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

# Why?

If you're used to software like Notion, going from assisted markdown to plain markdown may be a bit hard if you're not used to it. You'll probably have to work with a [cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) open in a tab in order to make sure you're not doing it wrong. <br/>
Also some syntaxes are a bit cumbersome to write like the [table](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/#extended-syntax) one.

So, if you're learning markdown or too lazy to write a table, this plugin is for you.

# How it works?

## Show the commands

All you have to do is to write a `>` whenever you want in a file, then make your choice.
